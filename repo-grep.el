;;; Commentary:
;; `repo-grep' runs a recursive grep through the folder structure of your Git
;; repository, SVN working copy, or plain folder. It uses the symbol under the
;; cursor as the default search term, which you can edit interactively. The
;; search term can include a regular expression, and you can configure regex
;; patterns as a prefix or suffix to further refine the search.
;;
;; The companion command `repo-grep-multi' extends this to a recursive grep
;; across multiple repositories or folders located in the same parent directory.
;;
;; Features include:
;; - VCS-aware project root detection (Git or SVN)
;; - Optional restriction to a subdirectory within the project
;; - Case sensitivity and binary file handling options
;; - Customisable include/exclude file patterns
;; - Clickable results in a standard *grep* buffer
;;
;; For installation, configuration, and usage examples, see the README and
;; the tutorial at https://github.com/BHFock/repo-grep.
